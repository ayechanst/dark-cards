### Welcome Teachers, Professors, and Friends (skip if you do not care)

This section is just a thanks to everyone involved in academia.
There is nothing better for a student than finding a teacher who loves what they do and cares
about providing quality education for the future of humanity. People at the speartip of humanity have gone through an education
system, and the people to thank are their professors, teachers, and mentors. Of course, those
people are very driven and hardworking, but as my swim coach always said: "Stay humble and
thank your coach." So, thank you, professors, teachers, and educators.

### About myself (skip if you don't care)

I graduated in 2023 from the University of West Florida with a degree in philosophy. During
my senior year, I began teaching myself to program so I had a trade to sell. My true passion
is philosophy, but I was unclear where to go with that besides more school. The thought
of a regular job also unsettled me, so I went with freelance programming specializing in
blockchains and crypto. The power of cryptography applied to consensus mechanisms across
the internet was amazing to learn about and build upon. I started giving back to the Internet
community, which helped me in my programming career with educational resources. However, I
quickly realized that these learning resources would have a much more significant impact on college students
as there are many more college students than self-taught programmers specializing in blockchains.

I was not a great student, which is relevant because I transformed myself
from a bad student to a relentless autodidact. The solution to the problem I am solving will be
helpful to students who identify as good students or bad for whatever reason. The solution is an
accelerator that helps bad students become excellent and good students with more free time.

# What is the problem I am trying to solve?

Memory and studying. The whole problem of college is that students need grades, and to get grades, they need to
study. Studying has friction because people study something multiple times to remember it. Remembering information is not necessarily understanding the information either. It may be information needed for a test in two weeks.
The possibility of forgetting the information amplifies the friction. Forgetting creates anxiety and a
feeling of unease as it's unclear how much to study something to remember it. From a broad scope, the problem I am trying to solve is the friction problem associated with studying.

# What is the solution?

The solution I found came from reading a book called "Unlimited Memory" by Kevin Horsley. I found a
solution to memory in the book. What I found myself for myself was a solution to friction. These two findings
compel me to program a tool that aids students in frictionlessly remembering information. Let's get into some critical
concepts from the book and some of my commentary that paint a picture of what my tool would provide.

#### 1. We learn in stories

Why do many people know so much about fictional worlds like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter? How about other inconsequential stories that do not directly affect our lives, like the story of a football season, events in a reality TV show, or geopolitics? Information we learn in school is a collection of
facts and skills. People don't remember scholarly information as easily as information consumed in their personal lives because the medium expressing scholarly information is suboptimal.

#### 2. The SEE principal

Stories and information have much better retention when they engage our senses, the first S in SEE. By
engaging our five senses, we link the information to our physical body and our "minds" (if you're a
mental dualist). E is for exaggerating. People love talking about their "crazy stories," and
that one time they did xyz. The stories are incredibly entertaining to exchange with people because
they are surreal, extraordinary, and exaggerated. The second E is for energize. By assigning movement to something, we remember it better because it's more engaging than something static. My point about stories and the SEE principle is that we are the ones
responsible for transcribing scholarly
information into a story ourselves. Using the SEE principle adds another layer of security to the remembered information.

### Transcribing information into stories

The brain transcribes information through a creative association process. Scholarly information
needs to be associated with a physical object. The physical object must be
in long-term memory, such as a car or desk. Then, a story is developed around those objects as more
information is committed to memory. Of course, when creating these stories, we need to rely on the SEE
principle. An example from the book is memorizing the ten superfoods using your car. A simplified version goes like this: Take an apple
and shove it through the front grill. Then, take a sharp carrot and stab it through the roof of your car. As you get closer to the windshield, you notice a bunch of breadcrumbs and think of their
grimy nature. The story continues and is more descriptive with the SEE principle but
serves as a framework for how transcribing arbitrary information in a story works.

The book boasts a lot about these techniques, so I took the time to use concepts from the
book to remember arbitrary information. I memorized the phone numbers of all my housemates, the 10
superfoods, and the birthdays and accomplishments of fifty of my favorite historical intellectuals. After going through all that work, I realized a problem with using ideas from the book.

### Problematic friction in the process

The amount of work and creativity I had to output to memorize these things was questionably worth it.
The most significant friction point between encoding information into a story and learning the story is
encoding the information into a story. After confirming that the memory
techniques were powerful, I thought, "Why don't people use these techniques for everything"? At the end of
the book, I was eager to encode all the information I was learning (Italian, piano, programming
concepts, cryptography concepts) into a story so I would never forget it. I was even displeased with school systems for not mentioning any of these techniques. However, after my trial
run of the book concept, I realized that much effort is needed to encode information into a story.
Then, it became evident that non-memory competitors don't use these techniques due
to the high upfront cost of implementation. Memory competitors use these techniques because they cannot recite pi to the 100,000 digits or memorize Earnest Hemmingway's "Old Man
and the Sea" without them.

Two separate things cause this friction and create barriers to entry to implement these techniques. Some people lack the belief that
they creatively encode information into a story. And other people will not make the time because,
as I found out, the work to implement these techniques is questionably worth the result. I use the word questionably, meaning it is worth asking oneself if the work is worth it, not that it is not worth it. Either way, my solution fixes both problems.

### My solution

Aside from the techniques, the most important thing I remembered from the book is the ten superfoods. The ten superfoods to me are just arbitrary "healthy foods," but the solution lies in why
I remembered them so well. The author gave the story and performed the frictional work of encoding the information for the reader.
Reading and remembering the story is relatively frictionless compared to creating the story.
My solution is to encode information into stories to be distributed on a large scale to help people learn better.

Professor

My name is Aye Chan. I graduated with a philosophy degree and a passion for learning and academia. I recently met Caleigh in the Biology program at your school, and the work being done at UCSC is fantastic.

I emailed you because I'm designing a digital tool to help students remember vocabulary better. By alleviating friction with vocabulary words, students can focus on the more exciting parts of biology, such as the concepts and mechanics of it all.

I need help crafting this tool, and by that, I mean I'd like a copy of a syllabus for the first biology class students take. I hope my tool helps you as much as it does the students. If you don't have time, just disregard this email. However, your help would be much appreciated because I can't find a course syllabus as a non-student! A referenceÂ to someone who can provide a syllabus would also be very helpful if you were the wrong person to reach out about this.

Thank you so much. I look forward to hearing from you,

- Aye Chan R. San Tun
